//To fix
Currently the slide animation doesnt use delta time
The slide animation needs to be rewritten to use the scroll bar
Need to use an observer to know when the renderer is present on screen
The planets rotation should carry momemtum from when the user spun it
//

The site begins with a sorta voice over

The background is a pastel color and the words
Hi, I'm Paul. 
Appear one after the other as someone speaks them

We then slide down to find the words 
Welcome to my World.
Those words are spoken as they fade in after we slode down

While we slide down 
It ends up sitting behind the text
The 3d model constantly rotates
The user can drag on it to make spin faster
Or even change its rotation
An svg path could go down from the dot of the first sentence
And wrap itself around the planet
If possible the text could be an svg path 

Also, a contextual menu appears on the side of screen
The menu is composed of dots 
One for each section of the page
When hovering over a dot
The title of the section fades in
It fades out once the mouse is removed
