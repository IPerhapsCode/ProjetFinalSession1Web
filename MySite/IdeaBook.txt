The site begins with a sorta voice over

The background is a pastel color and the words
Hi, I'm Paul. 
Appear one after the other as someone speaks them

We then slide down to find the words 
Welcome to my World.
Those words are spoken as we slide down

While we slide down 
A 3d model of a planet slides up
It ends up sitting behind the text
The 3d model constantly rotates
The user can drag on it to make spin faster
Or even change its rotation

Also, a contextual menu appears on the side of screen
The menu is composed of dots 
One for each section of the page
When hovering over a dot
The title of the section fades in
It fades out once the mouse is removed
